PLEASE DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPT IN YOUR MAIN SYSTEM WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE SCRIPT WORKS, YOU MIGHT END UP RUINING YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM. 


The script either fills up the hard drive keeping the new files hidden pretty quickly 
or
it encrypts all the files by using a temporary key and then deletes everything including the files, the key and the virus itself rendering the files either unrecoverable or unreadable if recovered.
